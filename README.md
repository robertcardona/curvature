This package requires the `soap-parser` package to be installed via pip in the 
working python environment.
In the `soap-parser` folder run `pip install -e /` in the root directory.
This will allow you to make changes to that code reflecting in this repository.
If missing, run `pip install POT` to add the optimal transport package.
